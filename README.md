Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Company: AMERISAVE MORTGAGE CORPORATION\nState: SC\nProduct: Mortgage\nSub-product: Conventional home mortgage\nIssue: Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage\nSub-issue: Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the application process\nComplaint: In XX/XX/2023, I inquired about this company regarding a Home Equity Line of Credit or Home Equity Loan. They advised me that they were not able to offer that however could offer a cash out refinance of my mortgage. I stated I was not interested in any refinance options as I have an excellent rate on my current mortgage and needed a relatively small amount of money for home repairs- it wouldn't make sense to triple my rate for my whole mortgage for that little amount. I ended the phone call having stated that I was not interested in what they were offering. Despite this, the company checked my credit and opened a mortgage application in my name. They have continued to contact me repeatedly over the past two months ( it is now XX/XX/2023 ) to 'get more information for my mortgage application ', have sent unsolicited copies of said application to my home which contain details such as my social security number and are therefore an identity theft risk to simply sit in the mailbox when I did not request or expect them, and have stated they will 'deny my application. ' Again, at no point did I EVER request that they open a mortgage application for a refinance and in fact explicitly and repeatedly stated I did not want to do a refinance with them or any other lender.
Company: Shellpoint Partners, LLC\nState: NY\nProduct: Mortgage\nSub-product: Conventional home mortgage\nIssue: Trouble during payment process\nSub-issue: Fees charged\nComplaint: Starting XX/XX/XXXX, my monthly mortgage payment was increased by {$410.00}. I contacted my current mortgage lender, Shellpoint Mortgage, to find out why my monthly payment amount increased and I was told that they added the lender paid home insurance premium on my account. I immediately sent the copy of my home insurance policy to Shellpoint Mortgage and confirmed with their customer representative they have received my insurance policy. However, they didnt remove/credit/waive the additional {$410.00} and require the master insurance policy for my condominium. Then, I provided our Homeowners Association and XXXX XXXX XXXX contact information to Shellpoint Mortgage so Shellpoint can request the copy directly from them. As of today, Shellpoint has not yet waived the additional monthly fee of {$410.00} and have charged 5 % penalty for the month of XXXX and XXXX because I refused to pay for the {$410.00}. The mortgage loan was initially from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX, then XXXX XXXX  sold the mortgage loan to Shellpoint during pandemic. The homeowner insurance was not required when I got the mortgage from XXXX XXXX in XXXX. Shellpoint added the requirement for requiring borrower to obtain additional homeowner insurance coverage. My annual homeowner insurance premium is less than {$500.00}. Shellpoint Mortgage charges the borrower ( me ) to pay for lender paid home insurance for {$410.00} monthly premium because they added this new requirement without the mortgagor agreement. I have clearly mentioned during the calls with the customer service representatives at Shellpoint that I refused to pay for the fees which I am not responsible for, not to mention I have my homeowner insurance coverage in place and have provided the policy to Shellpoint. Shellpoint Mortgage refused to waive/remove the {$410.00} lender paid home insurance premium and 5 % monthly penalty
